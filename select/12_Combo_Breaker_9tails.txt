Ay

Combo breaker life just done turned into realer shit (Realer shit)
Almost lost my bro the other day to prescriptions (Yeah)
Please just send him love
Been one hell of a month (It has)
I need that man here
I love my brothers like a son for real

Like how I stay inside
And hold my faith that I'll blow up for real
Hit my block for Backwoods
Then it's back to booting up FL
Talking sound like static
When the beat play from the beats pill
Moonrocks with some vodka
Making magic like I'm Copperfield
Woah (Smoke)
Quick to the mic no slow
Make beats then I hit flows
I just chopped my hair
I swear my fanbase is the only thing that grows
I might have some thorns and ya it shows
Mean as fuck, there's no payoff
Stop looking for my rose

Hoes (Hoes)
Stay all up in my phone (Yeah)
Can't talk in my zone
Even if I could I'd facetime
My main on the phone
Hands slide on her tattoos as I kiss her on the throat
This not Call of Duty but I got her going prone (Prone)
She say she love my tone
Said it sound like anger with a mix of monotone (Yeah)
I do not wear wool it make me itch
So why they calling me the goat
I don't know (Why the fuck?)
My personal opinion is that I'm not even close
I'd never boast about the shit that
I'm supposed to hold as passion (Passion)
Acting like I'll blow is what'll make it never happen (True)
Everybody saying they're the best is less than average
I see too much arrogance on
Twitter I can't stand it
I can't have it (No)

Outside is heat now
CP24 told me four shootings in a week now
Used to be downtown but now it's
Two blocks from my street now
City grizzly children need more safety
Than just seatbelts
Walking home from Starbucks get you
Jammed just for your drink now
When it's bright out (Sunny)
12 year olds are scared to ride their bikes out
Or fly kites out
Not even when it's night out
That shit make me wanna cry now, fuck

You can trust me
You can tell me
Things you wouldn't dare speak
There's not much I haven't seen
My thoughts are melting
You can trust me
You can love me
Without the worry of me leaving
For a few weeks at least
Girl take it or leave it

(Not okay, not okay)
(Ay, not okay, ay)
(Not okay)
