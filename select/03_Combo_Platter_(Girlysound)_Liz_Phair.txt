She said that it's probably a bad place to be
But it's probably worse than Manhattan
Looks like shit and it feels like America
Looks like shit and it feels like America

Take the train right up to the zoo
Don't look back on what you've been through
'Cause everyone's got a Monday
Looks like shit and it feels like America
Looks like shit and it feels like America

It's nice to be liked
But it's better by far to get paid
I know that most of the friends that I have
Don't really see it that way

But if you could give 'em each one wish
How much do you want to bet
They'd wish success for themselves and their friends
And that would include lots of money
I would surely include lots of money

So if there are any of you little green elves
Sitting out there today
Step right up wish me old Irish luck
But I also need shit loads of money

And if there are any of you dirty rich old men
Sitting up there in the shade
Step right up I'm a fuck
But I'm gonna need shit loads of money
I have got to have shit loads of money
I have got to have shit loads of money

You came over to my house
Didn't even knock you just walked inside
And when I didn't want to talk
You said, "Oh, God, I know all the bullshit"

Don't be so in love with yourself
Don't be so in love with yourself
Don't be so in love with yourself
'Cause I'm not, don't you know I'm not

And I said, "You've got a lot of nerve
Coming over here after all of the times
That you've tried to pull the wool over my eyes
And my ears and nose and mouth"

Don't be so in love with yourself
Don't be so in love with yourself
Don't be so in love with yourself
'Cause I'm not, don't you know I'm not

And I said, "You've got a lot of nerve
After all, it wasn't me who left and now
You're sleeping with that girl that you used
To say that you have always hated"

Don't be so in love with yourself
Don't be so in love with yourself
Don't be so in love with yourself
'Cause I'm not, don't you know I'm not
