I Don't Care, Whether It's Truth Or Dare,
Whether It's It's Fat Or Slim, Whether It's Good Or Mean.

I Don't Care, Whether It's Cool Or Hot,
Whether It Blows Your Top, Whether It's Hip Or Not.

It's All The Same, Everything's O.K., So Many Ways To Live By!

(Chorus)
I Feel Fine, Whether It's Your's Or Mine,
Whether It's Queer Or Square, Whether It's Here Or There!
Get A Grip, You're Starting Now To Make Me Sick, And Really,
Who Are You? To Give Me Just A Choice Of Two?

I Don't Care, Whether It's Hard Or Fair,
Whether It's Close Or Far, Whether It's Cooked Or Raw.

I Feel Fine!

I Don't Care, Whether It's Front Or Rear,
Whether It's Real Or A Steal, Whether Revealed Or Sealed.

It's All The Same, Everything's O.K., So Many Ways To Live By!

You're Light And Joy, No Piece Of Meat, So Many Ways To Live By!

(Chorus)

I Don't Hate, Whether It's Luck Or Fate,
Whether It's Sick Or Sad, Whether It's Nice Or Mad.

(Chorus)

I Feel Fine!
